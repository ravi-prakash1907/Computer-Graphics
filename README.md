## Computer-Graphics

This repository includes the programming implementations of various algorithms of _Computer Graphics_.These algorithms are few of the most treditional algos. used/taught in this field.<br />
Understanding these algorithms develops one's interest into the field of Computer Graphics.

### Types of Algorithms
I've included the following types of algorithms' implementation herein this repository:
> * Line Drawing
> * Line Clipping
> * Circle Drawing
> * Curve Tracing
> * 2D & 3D Transformation
>   * Scaling
>   * Translating
>   * Shearing
>   * Reflecting
>   * Rotating

I've designed the separate programs to implement these algorithms in ```C++``` language, which is well known for **OOPs**.<br />
To explore these algorithms even further, please visit [_C++ Programms_](C%2B%2B%20Programms).

This is also repo. to hold the practicals of the same subject, as per the prescription of the syllabus of _B.Sc. (Hons.) Computer Science_, **University of Delhi**.<br />
