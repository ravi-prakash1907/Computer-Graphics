## Algorithms in Computer Graphics

Though there are a lot of the algorithms used for various purposes in graphics, here we'll be dealing with very few of them that are easy to understand, as a beginer.<br /> <br />

These algorithms are are related to the folowing concepts:<br />
> * Line Drawing
> * Line Clipping
> * Circle Drawing
> * Curve Tracing
> * 2D & 3D Transformation
>   * Scaling
>   * Translating
>   * Shearing
>   * Reflecting
>   * Rotating
>   * Projection etc..

Most of these algorithms are from the prescribed practical list of syllabus of B.Sc. (H) Computer Science. Hence, those are placed separatly into [practicals](https://github.com/ravi-prakash1907/Computer-Graphics/tree/master/C%2B%2B%20Programms/practicals) directory. <br />
